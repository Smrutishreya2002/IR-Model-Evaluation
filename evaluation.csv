 There's no way to keep one's balance in a position where your weight is not over your feet and when your weight is over your feet so are your pesky trousers. 
 Now I'm pretty sure the locals don't remove their trousers because there's almost never a hook and the floor is often flooded. Exiting with wet trouser cuffs or socks wet from the toilet floor surely can't be socially acceptable! 
 And I'm completely utterly sure they don't wipe the porcelain and sit down making believe they're in the west because that would be dirty! 
 Well I'm here to say that after plenty of trips to plenty of countries with plenty of oriental eastern Asian toilets I've used both of these unsatisfactory workarounds but I still want to know one thing...

taat,149323,My name causes an issue with any booking! (names end with MR and MRS),"My name is Amr Eladawy. Whenever I get a ticket through an agent and they put my first name as  Amr , it lands as  A  only in the Airlines system. That happened with many airlines and different agents. That is pretty much annoying, specially during the online check-in. 
 When I make a direct booking from the airlines website, the ticket is issued as  ELADAWY/AMRMR .  
 It seems that there is a smart rule that considers the suffix  MR  as Mister and drops it.  
 Is this the correct behavior? What should I do to have my name printed correctly on my bookings. 
 
 In one of my bookings, the first and last name were swapped by mistake. However,  AMR  in the last name was not a problem at all.It seems that this rule is applied only on the first name. 
 The airlines will swear that they received the name as  A  and the agent will swear that the name was sent as  Amr . 
 The problem maybe in the GDS used to integrate the agent's system with the airlines's.   
 I sent an email to the GDS about this issue and they simply ignored me. 
 
 Now , moving forward.  Amr  is a very popular Arabic name. It's also a very old one and has been used for thousands of years. How to properly report this to the GDS providers and get this issue fixed?

taat,149323,My name causes an issue with any booking! (names end with MR and MRS),"My name is Amr Eladawy. Whenever I get a ticket through an agent and they put my first name as  Amr , it lands as  A  only in the Airlines system. That happened with many airlines and different agents. That is pretty much annoying, specially during the online check-in. 
 When I make a direct booking from the airlines website, the ticket is issued as  ELADAWY/AMRMR .  
 It seems that there is a smart rule that considers the suffix  MR  as Mister and drops it.  
 Is this the correct behavior? What should I do to have my name printed correctly on my bookings. 
 
 In one of my bookings, the first and last name were swapped by mistake. However,  AMR  in the last name was not a problem at all.It seems that this rule is applied only on the first name. 
 The airlines will swear that they received the name as  A  and the agent will swear that the name was sent as  Amr . 
 The problem maybe in the GDS used to integrate the agent's system with the airlines's.   
 I sent an email to the GDS about this issue and they simply ignored me. 
 
 Now , moving forward.  Amr  is a very popular Arabic name. It's also a very old one and has been used for thousands of years. How to properly report this to the GDS providers and get this issue fixed?

Apparently, the area was suddenly declared a red zone (danger zone) and all business owners in the district were put on a no-fly list. 
 The only way we were able to make it back to Canada was via Scandinavian northern routes flying close to the Arctic. Cost thousands of dollars, hundreds of hours and months in moral and mental pain.

Literally, at the gate, we were told that we were put on a no-fly list by Homeland Security because my father and I own a cargo business together located in eastern Turkey. Apparently, the area was suddenly declared a red zone (danger zone) and all business owners in the district were put on a no-fly list. 
 The only way we were able to make it back to Canada was via Scandinavian northern routes flying close to the Arctic. Cost thousands of dollars, hundreds of hours and months in moral and mental pain. We even had an issue sending my 1-year-old daughter on a flight with her mother to visit Turkey after that. I was told my one-year-old daughter's name was put on a no-fly list; when I heard this, I just felt like fainting and was holding myself not to cry in front of all these people. 
 On top of all of this even when we are able to fly back and forth via 2-3 stop northern routes to Canada we are now getting interrogated for 4-5 hour periods at our own airports by our own Canadian customs agents every single time. Life has been horrible with this issue handicapping us to live our normal lives. We are honest business people that have nothing to do with any illegal acts we have always been law-abiding citizens and will continue to do so. 
 Can anyone Help with this issue, or has anyone ever had any similar experience? Any resolution?
